Gender Detection Using Neural Networks

1.Artitificial Neural Network:
This is a basic model where i have built a sequential ANN model having rectifier actiavtion function and output layer with sigmoid fuction.
here first the image goes through grey scaling to convert rgb to one parameter, then it undergoes hogifying to convert the data completely to a 2d dataset.
This model detects wheather a person is man or woman by opening your webcam.

2.Convolution Neural Network:
This is a basic model of Conv2D where there is no need of gray-scaling and hog transformations.
This model detects wheather a person is man or woman by opening your webcam.

Requirements:
Tensorflow
sklearn
OpenCV
