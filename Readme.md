Gender Detection Using Neural Networks

1.Artitificial Neural Network:
This is a basic model where i have built a sequential ANN model having rectifier actiavtion function and output layer with sigmoid fuction.
here first the image goes through grey scaling and hogifying to convert rgb to one parameter.
This model detects wheather a person is man or woman by opening your webcam.

Requirements:
Tensorflow
sklearn
OpenCV
